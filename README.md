# SoulWorker-Emulation
Collective resource of information to maybe one day emulate the MMORPG SoulWorker

Might be a good idea to dig around a bit and look for existing up to date emulators that are already available (If they are updated...) 

# Running "Without Steam"

Select SoulWorker.exe, right click and create a shortcut with the following Command Line Parameters.

--ip 194.187.19.129 --port 10000 --steam

# Information
WireShark required to actually obtain all data

This filter seems to work nicely..

tcp and net 194.187.19.0/24 or net 206.253.175.37 or net 94.187.19.130
